# Wednesday Morning Exercise:

### This lab will be working primarily with Classes, but it will also give you practice with array methods, objects, functions, and other JS stuff. Plus some DOM. I don't expect anyone to finish it and we will go over it when I get there.

# Objective:
### Create a simple interface You will have a few buttons on the screen,
### which will correspond to a few products (e.g. TV, Watch, Shoes, etc.).

* You will also have a shopping cart on the screen. 

* (It can look terrible, that's fine, although extra points for styling, also the points mean nothing).

When you click on one of the product buttons it should add a product to the shopping cart and display the price, as well. There should also be a total dollar amount displayed in the cart.

You can add or remove products from the cart.

* For this lab you will need a minimum of one class per product as well as a shopping cart class. You can also try to make a Product class, which the other product class with 'extend' (although this is not necessary; if you do go this route: remember, if you make a Product class it should only have the functionality/methods/properties that all products will need). 

Think about all the stuff you may want on a product… the price, whether or not it is on sale, the description, the item name, whether it is in stock, a unique id… those can all be properties of your class!

* Your shopping cart will be a class, as well, and that will need properties and methods. A property might be the products array, which are all the products in the cart. You might also want to have methods for adding and removing products and for calculating the total price.

None of this is mandatory but just think about what you might want each class to have as properties and what methods you think would be useful. Take it step by step, and realize this lab is more about understanding what classes can do, how they can model real world entities, and how to store and retrieve information from them. 

If you are completely totally and irreversibly stuck before I get there go ahead and continue to work on the square lab from yesterday; if you are done with that try to make the square a class! 

Tip: feel free to do this however you wish and in whatever order, but if it were me I would try to do all the javascript classes and testing that they do what I want first before integrating it into the UI. ALSO if you have questions while you're doing this, write them down!
